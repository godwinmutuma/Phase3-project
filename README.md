# Customer Churn Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction
Customer retention is essential for profitability in the highly competitive telecom industry. This report analyzes factors influencing customer churn and provides actionable insights to mitigate churn rates.  
Using advanced data analysis techniques, we explore customer behavior, focusing on usage patterns, customer service interactions, and subscription plan preferences to uncover patterns that contribute to churn.

## 2. Data Overview
The dataset includes customer details, usage metrics, and subscription plans. Preprocessing steps and techniques used include:

### Preprocessing Techniques:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensured a complete dataset by removing a column with significant missing data.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and removed to enhance data quality.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables (`churn`, `international plan`, `voicemail plan`) were encoded for analysis.
- **Balancing Dataset**: Recognized the imbalance in the target variable (`churn`), suggesting the need for oversampling or undersampling in future modeling.

## 3. Key Insights and Visualizations

### **Churn Distribution**
**Technique Used**: Bar Plot  
- Reveals an imbalance, with fewer customers churning compared to those retained.  
- **Insight**: Dataset imbalance must be addressed for reliable predictive modeling.  

---

### **Total Day Minutes vs. Churn**
**Technique Used**: Boxplot  
- Customers with higher total day minutes have a greater likelihood of churning.  
- **Insight**: High-usage customers might be dissatisfied, potentially due to costs or service issues.  

---

### **Customer Service Calls vs. Churn**
**Technique Used**: Bar Plot  
- A positive correlation exists between the number of customer service calls and churn.  
- **Insight**: Frequent customer service interactions indicate unresolved issues or dissatisfaction.  

---

### **International Plan Impact**
**Technique Used**: Bar Plot  
- Customers with an international plan have significantly higher churn rates.  
- **Insight**: Possible dissatisfaction with pricing or perceived value of the international plan.  

---

### **Correlation Matrix**
**Technique Used**: Heatmap  
- Strong correlations observed:
  - **Total Day Minutes, Calls, and Charges**: Highly correlated, indicating feature redundancy.  
  - Features like **Customer Service Calls** and **International Plan**: Weak correlations with numerical variables but significant impacts on churn.

## 4. Recommendations

### **1. Improve Customer Service**
- Conduct targeted training for representatives to address frequent complaints.  
- Proactively engage high-risk customers with unresolved issues.

### **2. Reevaluate High-Usage Customer Plans**
- Offer personalized or discounted plans tailored for high-usage customers to enhance satisfaction.  

### **3. Optimize International Plans**
- Reassess pricing and features to deliver competitive value.  
- Conduct customer surveys to better understand dissatisfaction with the international plan.  

### **4. Address Data Imbalance**
- Use oversampling or undersampling techniques to balance the dataset for accurate predictive modeling.  

### **5. Implement Predictive Models**
- Develop machine learning models to identify high-risk customers early and implement targeted retention strategies.
